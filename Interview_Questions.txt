Support Engineer Take-home Assessment for GitLab <Not completed in time>
    Notes: Not completed in their allotted time of five days. 

Important: While working on this assessment, you can consult external sources, but you
must cite them. We are looking for answers in your own words.


1. Write a Ruby or Bash script that will print usernames of all users on a Linux system together with their home directories. Here's some example output:

gitlab:/home/gitlab
nobody:/nonexistent
.

As you can see, each line is a concatenation of a username, the colon character (:), and the home directory path for that username. Your script should output such a line for each user on the system.

Next, write a crontab entry that accomplishes the following:
● Runs once every hour.
● Takes the output of your above script and converts it to an MD5 hash.
● Stores the MD5 hash into the /var/log/current_users file.
● On subsequent runs, if the MD5 sum changes, it should log this change in the /var/log/user_changes file with the message, DATE TIME changes occurred, replacing DATE and TIME with appropriate values. Make sure to replace the old MD5 hash in /var/log/current_users file with the new MD5 hash.

Both the script and crontab entry should be provided for the answer to be complete.


2. A user is complaining that it's taking a long time to load a page on our web application. In your own words, write down and discuss the possible cause(s) of the slowness. Also describe how you would begin to troubleshoot this issue?

Keep the following information about the environment in mind:
● The web application is written in a modern MVC web framework.
● Application data is stored in a relational database.
● All components (web application, web server, database) are running on a single Linux box with 8GB RAM, 2 CPU cores, and SSD storage with ample free space.
● You have root access to this Linux box.

We are interested in learning about your experience with modern web applications, and your ability to reason about system design and architectural trade-offs. There are no right and wrong answers to this question. Feel free to write as much or as little as you feel is necessary.

3. Study the Git commit graph shown below. What sequence of Git commands could have resulted in this commit graph?


            (Feature-Branch)
                  int   
           ↑           ↓
[]     -> [] -> [] -> [] -> []
int       int   int   int    HEAD
                MAIN

4. GitLab has hired you to write a Git tutorial for beginners on: Using Git to implement a new feature/change without affecting the main branch 

In your own words, write a tutorial/blog explaining things in a beginner-friendly way. Make sure to address both the "why" and "how" for each Git command you use. Assume the audience are readers of a well-known blog.

5. What is a technical book/blog you read recently that you enjoyed? Please include a brief review of what you especially liked or didn’t like about it.

    <Video recorded, I think I misinterpreted the questions>

1. How do you get a host name via it's IP address using the command line?
    nslookup %ipaddress%
    nbtstat -A %ipaddress%
    host <ipaddress>

2. What does MBR mean and stand for?
MBR stands for Master Boot Record. To explain it more, it is simply a part of a hard disk where all the information about the disk can be found. We can find it in the boot sector and it contains details of types of partitions and also the code which is required at the time booting the operating system of the computer.

3. What is a BIOS and what does it do?
BIOS is short for Basic Input-Output system. Its low-level software that resides in a chip on your computers motherboard. The BIOS loads when your computer starts up, and the BIOS is responsible for waking up your computers hardware components, ensures theyre functioning properly, and then runs the bootloader that boots Windows or whatever other operating system you have installed.

4. What is or how would you describe a computers registry?
The registry or Windows registry is a database of information, settings, options, and other values for software and hardware installed on all versions of Microsoft Windows operating systems. When a program is installed, a new subkey is created in the registry. This subkey contains settings specific to that program, such as its location, version, and primary executable.

5. What are the five different HIVES in Windows Registry?
HKCR (HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT): Describes file type, file extension, and OLE information.
HKCU (HKEY_CURRENT_USER): Contains user who is currently logged in to Windows and their settings.
HKLM (HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE): Contains computer-specific information about the hardware installed, software settings, and other information. The information is used for all users who log on to that computer. This key, and its subkeys, is one of the most frequently areas of the registry viewed and edited by users.
HKU (HKEY_USERS): Contains information about all the users who log on to the computer, including both generic and user-specific information.
HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG (HKCC) 	The details about the current configuration of hardware attached to the computer.

6. What are the differences between NTFS and FAT32?

The FAT32 file system cannot store individual files larger than 4 GB, while the NTFS file system can. Compared to FAT32, the NTFS file system has higher disk utilization and can manage disk space more effectively.  The read and write speeds of NTFS are also faster than that of FAT32. The FAT32 file system is suitable for smaller capacity flash memory devices (such as memory cards, USB drives, and other storage devices), while the NTFS file system is suitable for large capacity disks.

7. What does ARP stand for and what is it used for?
What is Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)?

Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is a procedure for mapping a dynamic IP address to a permanent physical machine address in a local area network (LAN). The physical machine address is also known as a media access control (MAC) address. The job of ARP is essentially to translate 32-bit addresses to 48-bit addresses and vice versa. This is necessary because IP addresses in IP version 4 (IPv4) are 32 bits, but MAC addresses are 48 bits. ARP works between Layers 2 and 3 of the Open Systems Interconnection model (OSI model). The MAC address exists on Layer 2 of the OSI model, the data link layer. The IP address exists on Layer 3, the network layer.

8. What is a default gateway used for?
A default gateway makes it possible for devices in one network to communicate with devices in another network. If a computer, for example, requests a web page, the request goes through the default gateway before exiting the local network (LAN) to reach the internet. Think of a default gateway as an intermediate device between the local network and the internet. The default gateway transfers internal data to the internet and back again. 

9. What is a network mask?
A subnetwork or subnet is a logical subdivision of an IP network. The practice of dividing a network into two or more networks is called subnetting. 

10. Tell me about a specific problem you have solved. Not a we solved this or that, but a specific situation. These are the steps I took, resolution and the outcome.
