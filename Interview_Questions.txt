Interview Questions for further growth

Support Engineer Take-home Assessment for GitLab <Not completed in time>
    Notes: Not completed in their allotted time of five days. 

Important: While working on this assessment, you can consult external sources, but you
must cite them. We are looking for answers in your own words.


1. Write a Ruby or Bash script that will print usernames of all users on a Linux system together with their home directories. Here's some example output:

gitlab:/home/gitlab
nobody:/nonexistent
.

As you can see, each line is a concatenation of a username, the colon character (:), and the home directory path for that username. Your script should output such a line for each user on the system.

Next, write a crontab entry that accomplishes the following:
● Runs once every hour.
● Takes the output of your above script and converts it to an MD5 hash.
● Stores the MD5 hash into the /var/log/current_users file.
● On subsequent runs, if the MD5 sum changes, it should log this change in the /var/log/user_changes file with the message, DATE TIME changes occurred, replacing DATE and TIME with appropriate values. Make sure to replace the old MD5 hash in /var/log/current_users file with the new MD5 hash.

Both the script and crontab entry should be provided for the answer to be complete.


2. A user is complaining that it's taking a long time to load a page on our web application. In your own words, write down and discuss the possible cause(s) of the slowness. Also describe how you would begin to troubleshoot this issue?

Keep the following information about the environment in mind:
● The web application is written in a modern MVC web framework.
● Application data is stored in a relational database.
● All components (web application, web server, database) are running on a single Linux box with 8GB RAM, 2 CPU cores, and SSD storage with ample free space.
● You have root access to this Linux box.

We are interested in learning about your experience with modern web applications, and your ability to reason about system design and architectural trade-offs. There are no right and wrong answers to this question. Feel free to write as much or as little as you feel is necessary.

3. Study the Git commit graph shown below. What sequence of Git commands could have resulted in this commit graph?


            (Feature-Branch)
                  int   
           ↑           ↓
[]     -> [] -> [] -> [] -> []
int       int   int   int    HEAD
                MAIN

4. GitLab has hired you to write a Git tutorial for beginners on: Using Git to implement a new feature/change without affecting the main branch 

In your own words, write a tutorial/blog explaining things in a beginner-friendly way. Make sure to address both the "why" and "how" for each Git command you use. Assume the audience are readers of a well-known blog.

5. What is a technical book/blog you read recently that you enjoyed? Please include a brief review of what you especially liked or didn’t like about it.

Veeam Cloud Support Engineer via Apex Systems Recruiters
    <Video recorded, I think I misinterpreted the questions>

1. How do you get a host name via it's IP address using the command line?
    nslookup %ipaddress%
    nbtstat -A %ipaddress%
    host <ipaddress>

2. What does MBR mean and stand for?
MBR stands for Master Boot Record. To explain it more, it is simply a part of a hard disk where all the information about the disk can be found. We can find it in the boot sector and it contains details of types of partitions and also the code which is required at the time booting the operating system of the computer.

3. What is a BIOS and what does it do?
BIOS is short for Basic Input-Output system. Its low-level software that resides in a chip on your computers motherboard. The BIOS loads when your computer starts up, and the BIOS is responsible for waking up your computers hardware components, ensures theyre functioning properly, and then runs the bootloader that boots Windows or whatever other operating system you have installed.

4. What is or how would you describe a computers registry?
The registry or Windows registry is a database of information, settings, options, and other values for software and hardware installed on all versions of Microsoft Windows operating systems. When a program is installed, a new subkey is created in the registry. This subkey contains settings specific to that program, such as its location, version, and primary executable.

5. What are the five different HIVES in Windows Registry?
HKCR (HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT): Describes file type, file extension, and OLE information.
HKCU (HKEY_CURRENT_USER): Contains user who is currently logged in to Windows and their settings.
HKLM (HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE): Contains computer-specific information about the hardware installed, software settings, and other information. The information is used for all users who log on to that computer. This key, and its subkeys, is one of the most frequently areas of the registry viewed and edited by users.
HKU (HKEY_USERS): Contains information about all the users who log on to the computer, including both generic and user-specific information.
HKEY_CURRENT_CONFIG (HKCC) 	The details about the current configuration of hardware attached to the computer.

6. What are the differences between NTFS and FAT32?

The FAT32 file system cannot store individual files larger than 4 GB, while the NTFS file system can. Compared to FAT32, the NTFS file system has higher disk utilization and can manage disk space more effectively.  The read and write speeds of NTFS are also faster than that of FAT32. The FAT32 file system is suitable for smaller capacity flash memory devices (such as memory cards, USB drives, and other storage devices), while the NTFS file system is suitable for large capacity disks.

7. What does ARP stand for and what is it used for?
What is Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)?

Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is a procedure for mapping a dynamic IP address to a permanent physical machine address in a local area network (LAN). The physical machine address is also known as a media access control (MAC) address. The job of ARP is essentially to translate 32-bit addresses to 48-bit addresses and vice versa. This is necessary because IP addresses in IP version 4 (IPv4) are 32 bits, but MAC addresses are 48 bits. ARP works between Layers 2 and 3 of the Open Systems Interconnection model (OSI model). The MAC address exists on Layer 2 of the OSI model, the data link layer. The IP address exists on Layer 3, the network layer.

8. What is a default gateway used for?
A default gateway makes it possible for devices in one network to communicate with devices in another network. If a computer, for example, requests a web page, the request goes through the default gateway before exiting the local network (LAN) to reach the internet. Think of a default gateway as an intermediate device between the local network and the internet. The default gateway transfers internal data to the internet and back again. 

9. What is a network mask?
A subnetwork or subnet is a logical subdivision of an IP network. The practice of dividing a network into two or more networks is called subnetting. 

10. Tell me about a specific problem you have solved. Not a we solved this or that, but a specific situation. These are the steps I took, resolution and the outcome.

Notes: Had to request it from an azure site using HTTP Invoke-RestMethod

Excellent work human!

We have just a few more questions for you. Please complete these questions and
submit your answers as a plain text file to the unique link in the email from your
Talent Partner. Just to be clear, the email that sent you instructions for POSTing
JSON to this robot is the right one and you will see the link on where to submit
your responses.

The following is a series of customer questions, most of them coming from real
customer interactions. For each question, write a customer-facing response. For
questions that you don't know the answers to, feel free to search for answers
online and provide the sources you used. Do not invent facts and do not be
afraid to ask the customer for information, if needed.

We will be looking at overall content, ability to research technical questions,
ability to present a professional yet friendly response to customers, and your
ability to intuit details based on very limited information. This questionnaire
should take no more than two hours to complete. If you get stuck, don't be
afraid to ask us to clarify anything.


A few things to keep in mind:

* It should always be clear to the person on the other side of the computer that
  you are a smart, friendly, and awesome person.
* Responses should not contain unneeded filler, yet should not be overly brief.
  They should be complete.
* Responses should have a greeting and closing.
* GitHub is spelled with a capital G and a capital H.
* GitHub is classy. When in doubt: be classy.

We've also provided an question and response below as an example:

------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Example Question

You receive the following email:

> One developer in our trial is trying to upload around 4 GB of game data
> into a repository (over http) and it fails:
>
>     ~/assets % git push -u origin master
>     Username for 'http://ghe-enterprise': john.doe
>     Password for 'http://john.doe@ghe-enterprise':
>     Counting objects: 19130, done.
>     Delta compression using up to 8 threads.
>     Compressing objects: 100% (18763/18763), done.
>     error: RPC failed; result=22, HTTP code = 413
>     fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly
>     Writing objects: 100% (19130/19130), 1.20 GiB | 6.05 MiB/s, done.
>     Total 19130 (delta 4322), reused 0 (delta 0)
>     fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly
>     Everything up-to-date

# Example Response

> Hi <Customer>,
>
> There are a few scenarios here that may be contributing to the problem:
>
> - HTTP is generally not the preferred transfer method for larger files. In this case 
> we can see that only 1.2GB of the push is written prior to the connection being dropped. 
> For scenarios like this, we generally recommend using SSH connectivity - could you please 
> try repeating the push over SSH rather than HTTP?
> - The HTTP response noted above ([413](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/413)) 
> also suggests a server side rejection due to file size. In this case, it may be individual 
> large files that are contributing to the overall problem.
> - As you'd mentioned pushing game data, you may wish to consider using [LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) to 
> store any of the large, non-source code, files associated with this repository. This may 
> considerably reduce the amount of data that needs to be transferred and stored directly 
> in the repository.
>
> With these considered, along with the partial transfer, you may also be able to see some 
> success with multiple smaller commits, each pushing up a subset of the overall data that 
> needs to be committed.
>
> Please give these approaches a try and let me know your results. If you have any questions 
> in the interim, I'm more than happy to help!
>
> Regards,
> Mona Lisa Octocat

# Question 1

You receive the following ticket from a customer:

> Hi GitHub!
> So according to the docs at https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server/rest/reference/teams#add-or-update-team-repository-permissions,
> I should be able to add teams to a repo programmatically.
>
> However, this does not work when using the following code:
>
> curl -H "Authorization: token BLAHBLAHBLAH" -H "Content-Length: 0" -X put \
>      -d "" https://hostname/api/v3/organizations/10/team/23/repos/jimmy/some-repo-name
>
> Could someone give me a curl one liner that lets me add teams to repos ? Or at
> least tell me what facet of the documentation has escaped me for the last 45 minutes?

# Response 1



# Question 2

You receive the following ticket from a customer with 1000 GitHub Enterprise Server seats:

> Hi GitHub,
>
> We are experiencing serious performance issues and receiving multiple complaints from our developers.
>
> Browsing the web interface often results in timeouts and Git operations are taking magnitudes longer than usual to complete.
>
> $ free -m
>              total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
> Mem:         45993      43944       1989          0        149      18510
> -/+ buffers/cache:      25285      20648
> Swap:            0          0          0
> $ uptime
> 10:50:08 up 123 days, 25 min,  1 user,  load average: 18.25, 15.51, 9.75

What could be causing these performance issues? What would you recommend doing to mitigate these issues?

Notes

You do not have shell or web interface access to their GitHub Enterprise instance.

# Response 2



# Question 3

You receive a ticket from ACME, Inc. asking if it's possible to adjust GitHub
Enterprise's web-interface to match their corporate identity better.

> Hi,
> At ACME, Inc. we have many services running in-house, all matching our orange
> colored corporate design and showing the ACME, Inc. logo. GitHub Enterprise is
> the only service that does not seem to support this. How can we alter GitHub
> Enterprise's design?

GitHub currently does not support modifications to GitHub Enterprise's
web-interface for two reasons:

* GitHub Enterprise was designed to match GitHub.com to preserve the familiarity
  many software developers around the world have already acquired on GitHub.com.
  Changing the GitHub user experience by altering its design could be too
  confusing for the people actually using our product.
* Changing GitHub Enterprise's design would only be a cosmetic change. It
  wouldn't have a huge impact on improving how people collaborate and work
  together as other features we could be working on. There are other items on
  our product's roadmap with a higher prioritization.

Taking these reasons into account, how would you respond to the customer using
your own words?

# Response 3



# Question 4

You receive the following ticket from a customer:

> Hi!
>
> After installing the latest update this morning I noticed that my browsers are
> now throwing Invalid SSL Cert errors when attempting to access our instance.
>
> $ curl -I https://github.acme.edu
> curl: (60) SSL certificate problem, verify that the CA cert is OK. Details:
> error:14090086:SSL routines:SSL3_GET_SERVER_CERTIFICATE:certificate verify failed
> More details here: http://curl.haxx.se/docs/sslcerts.html
>
> Not sure if anyone else has reported this or what I might be able to do to fix
> it. I've re-uploaded our key & cert file to no avail.

Notes

You do not have shell or web interface access to their GitHub Enterprise instance.
We'd love to see you provide specific command line troubleshooting steps using common
Linux tools for the customer and have them return the results.

# Response 4



# Finally

We'd also love if you could share more about yourself so the team can get to know you better!
If you could fill this out and send it back along with your responses that would be great:

      * Legal Name?
      * Location?
      * What's an impressionable experience you've had with customer service/support, and why?
      * Tell us about a time where you helped someone.
      * What appeals to you about GitHub, as a company you'd potentially be working for?
      * How would you describe what GitHub does to a non-technical person?
      * What motivates you to work in support?
