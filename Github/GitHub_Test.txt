Excellent work human!

We have just a few more questions for you. Please complete these questions and
submit your answers as a plain text file to the unique link in the email from your
Talent Partner. Just to be clear, the email that sent you instructions for POSTing
JSON to this robot is the right one and you will see the link on where to submit
your responses.

The following is a series of customer questions, most of them coming from real
customer interactions. For each question, write a customer-facing response. For
questions that you don't know the answers to, feel free to search for answers
online and provide the sources you used. Do not invent facts and do not be
afraid to ask the customer for information, if needed.

We will be looking at overall content, ability to research technical questions,
ability to present a professional yet friendly response to customers, and your
ability to intuit details based on very limited information. This questionnaire
should take no more than two hours to complete. If you get stuck, don't be
afraid to ask us to clarify anything.


A few things to keep in mind:

* It should always be clear to the person on the other side of the computer that
  you are a smart, friendly, and awesome person.
* Responses should not contain unneeded filler, yet should not be overly brief.
  They should be complete.
* Responses should have a greeting and closing.
* GitHub is spelled with a capital G and a capital H.
* GitHub is classy. When in doubt: be classy.

We've also provided an question and response below as an example:

# Example Question

You receive the following email:

> One developer in our trial is trying to upload around 4 GB of game data
> into a repository (over http) and it fails:
>
>     ~/assets % git push -u origin master
>     Username for 'http://ghe-enterprise': john.doe
>     Password for 'http://john.doe@ghe-enterprise':
>     Counting objects: 19130, done.
>     Delta compression using up to 8 threads.
>     Compressing objects: 100% (18763/18763), done.
>     error: RPC failed; result=22, HTTP code = 413
>     fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly
>     Writing objects: 100% (19130/19130), 1.20 GiB | 6.05 MiB/s, done.
>     Total 19130 (delta 4322), reused 0 (delta 0)
>     fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly
>     Everything up-to-date

# Example Response

> Hi <Customer>,
>
> There are a few scenarios here that may be contributing to the problem:
>
> - HTTP is generally not the preferred transfer method for larger files. In this case 
> we can see that only 1.2GB of the push is written prior to the connection being dropped. 
> For scenarios like this, we generally recommend using SSH connectivity - could you please 
> try repeating the push over SSH rather than HTTP?
> - The HTTP response noted above ([413](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/413)) 
> also suggests a server side rejection due to file size. In this case, it may be individual 
> large files that are contributing to the overall problem.
> - As you'd mentioned pushing game data, you may wish to consider using [LFS](https://git-lfs.github.com/) to 
> store any of the large, non-source code, files associated with this repository. This may 
> considerably reduce the amount of data that needs to be transferred and stored directly 
> in the repository.
>
> With these considered, along with the partial transfer, you may also be able to see some 
> success with multiple smaller commits, each pushing up a subset of the overall data that 
> needs to be committed.
>
> Please give these approaches a try and let me know your results. If you have any questions 
> in the interim, I'm more than happy to help!

> Mona Lisa Octocat

# Question 1

You receive the following ticket from a customer:

> Hi GitHub!
> So according to the docs at https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server/rest/reference/teams#add-or-update-team-repository-permissions,
> I should be able to add teams to a repo programmatically.
>
> However, this does not work when using the following code:
>
> curl -H "Authorization: token BLAHBLAHBLAH" -H "Content-Length: 0" -X put \
>      -d "" https://hostname/api/v3/organizations/10/team/23/repos/jimmy/some-repo-name
>
> Could someone give me a curl one liner that lets me add teams to repos ? Or at
> least tell me what facet of the documentation has escaped me for the last 45 minutes?

# Response 1



# Question 2

You receive the following ticket from a customer with 1000 GitHub Enterprise Server seats:

> Hi GitHub,
>
> We are experiencing serious performance issues and receiving multiple complaints from our developers.
>
> Browsing the web interface often results in timeouts and Git operations are taking magnitudes longer than usual to complete.
>
> $ free -m
>              total       used       free     shared    buffers     cached
> Mem:         45993      43944       1989          0        149      18510
> -/+ buffers/cache:      25285      20648
> Swap:            0          0          0
> $ uptime
> 10:50:08 up 123 days, 25 min,  1 user,  load average: 18.25, 15.51, 9.75

What could be causing these performance issues? What would you recommend doing to mitigate these issues?

Notes

You do not have shell or web interface access to their GitHub Enterprise instance.

# Question 3

You receive a ticket from ACME, Inc. asking if it's possible to adjust GitHub
Enterprise's web-interface to match their corporate identity better.

> Hi,
> At ACME, Inc. we have many services running in-house, all matching our orange
> colored corporate design and showing the ACME, Inc. logo. GitHub Enterprise is
> the only service that does not seem to support this. How can we alter GitHub
> Enterprise's design?

GitHub currently does not support modifications to GitHub Enterprise's
web-interface for two reasons:

* GitHub Enterprise was designed to match GitHub.com to preserve the familiarity
  many software developers around the world have already acquired on GitHub.com.
  Changing the GitHub user experience by altering its design could be too
  confusing for the people actually using our product.
* Changing GitHub Enterprise's design would only be a cosmetic change. It
  wouldn't have a huge impact on improving how people collaborate and work
  together as other features we could be working on. There are other items on
  our product's roadmap with a higher prioritization.

Taking these reasons into account, how would you respond to the customer using
your own words?

# Question 4

You receive the following ticket from a customer:

> Hi!
>
> After installing the latest update this morning I noticed that my browsers are
> now throwing Invalid SSL Cert errors when attempting to access our instance.
>
> $ curl -I https://github.acme.edu
> curl: (60) SSL certificate problem, verify that the CA cert is OK. Details:
> error:14090086:SSL routines:SSL3_GET_SERVER_CERTIFICATE:certificate verify failed
> More details here: http://curl.haxx.se/docs/sslcerts.html
>
> Not sure if anyone else has reported this or what I might be able to do to fix
> it. I've re-uploaded our key & cert file to no avail.

Notes

You do not have shell or web interface access to their GitHub Enterprise instance.
We'd love to see you provide specific command line troubleshooting steps using common
Linux tools for the customer and have them return the results.

# Finally

We'd also love if you could share more about yourself so the team can get to know you better!
If you could fill this out and send it back along with your responses that would be great:

      * Legal Name?
      * Location?
      * What's an impressionable experience you've had with customer service/support, and why?
      * Tell us about a time where you helped someone.
      * What appeals to you about GitHub, as a company you'd potentially be working for?
      * How would you describe what GitHub does to a non-technical person?
      * What motivates you to work in support?
